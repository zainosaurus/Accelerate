# Accelerate
Accelerates a ball on the screen (my attempt at making a 2d movement game)

Move the ball on-screen using arrow keys. I tried to make it possible to click a location on the screen and have the ball move 
to that location (and stop there), but it doesn't work. (Try clicking and you'll see). This is probably due to some error in the 
physics that I programmed. A source of error was the fact that there were 60 frames er second and i tried to account for that 
(by applying 1/60 of the acceleration each frame). That's probably not the best way to go around doing that but I couldn't think 
of a better way.

Anyways, I gave up on the program (for now anyways, idk if i will pick it up again)
